1. Project Objective
- Develop an intelligent website (bot) leveraging CoinGecko's library for data retrieval to make informed buy/sell decisions on Bitcoin and Ethereum, targeting a steady 10% monthly return over the previous year without the use of API keys.

2. Data Sources
- Utilize the CoinGecko library for fetching technical analysis and cryptocurrency data directly, avoiding the necessity for any API keys and bypassing the use of exchanges like Binance for streamlined data access.

3. Programming Language
- Python will be the development language of choice, ensuring seamless integration with the CoinGecko library and efficient data processing.

4. Performance Criteria
- The bot is to analyze historical data spanning the last 12 months to validate its investment strategy, aiming for a consistent monthly return of 10%.

5. User Interface
- Implement a straightforward web interface (index.html) to display buying and selling signals generated by the bot, functioning as a user dashboard.

6. Python Integration with Web Interface
- Employ a Python web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) to host the web interface, facilitating the display of real-time trading advice on an HTML page.

7. Technical Specifications
- The system should be user-friendly to initiate and operate. Detailed setup instructions will cover dependency installation, configuration necessities, and bot activation procedures.
- A requirements.txt file will be included to streamline the installation of essential Python libraries.
- Sensitivity and customization settings (like those typically requiring API keys) will be managed using environment variables or a configuration file, ensuring secure and flexible configuration without the need for API keys.

8. Ease of Launch
- A launch script (run.sh for Unix/Linux or start.bat for Windows) will be provided to encapsulate command lines needed to fire up the web server and boot up the bot, designed for straightforward execution.
